1000 
1. Divide response time by the question timer. For example, a player responded 2 seconds after a 30-second question timer started. 2 divided by 30 is 0.0667.
2. Divide that value by 2. For example, 0.0667 divided by 2 is 0.0333.
3. Subtract that value from 1. For example, 1 minus 0.0333 is 0.9667.
4. Multiply points possible by that value. For example, 1000 points possible multiplied by 0.9667 is 966.7.
5. Round to the nearest whole number. For example, 966.7 is 967 points.
For math wizards, this can be expressed as:

⌊ ( 1 - (( {response time} / {question timer} ) / 2 )) {points possible} ⌉
